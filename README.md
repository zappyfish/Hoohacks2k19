TODO: 

1. In the SyllabusParser class, add whatever fields you need and complete the constructor however you like. Then, complete the getSyllabusEvents method. I will try to find example input strings ASAP so you know what you're working with, but you might also be able to find some by googling them/working with Anna. For each event-date pair, you can create a SyllabusEvent object and add it to the list that is returned. An example of doing so is in the method body (delete it when you're done).
